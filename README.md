### Dataset Description 

This dataset is from Kaggle: 5000 Movie Dataset and contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

2) How did film budgets change from each decade?

3) 1990s has the highest film budget on average while 1970s has the lowest.

6) Vote Count, Budget, and Popularity has highest association with the movies that have high revenues.


### Limitations:
1) The dataset contains null and zero values in some features. These zero and null values hinders the analysis and have to be removed. so data cleaning is a necessary part before moving on to the dataset's investigation.
2) There were multiple genres in each movie, I split the genress so each genre is allocated to 1 row.
3) The revenue and budget were not denominated in currency, so itâ€™s unsure whether they are in USD, or another currency.
